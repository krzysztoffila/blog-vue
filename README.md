# Real-time Blog with Language Preferences

The Blog Vue project is a real-time blog that allows users to search for posts instantly. It uses cookies to store the preferred language (PL/EN) in which posts are written.

- **HTML:** The structure of web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling for an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to applications.
- **Vue.js:** JavaScript framework for creating user interfaces version 2.
- **Firebase:** Used for real-time data synchronization and hosting.
- **Bootstrap Vue:** Framework for building responsive and mobile applications.

This was my first Vue.js project that I coded under the guidance of an experienced programmer. We communicated with each other using JIRA, where he would drop tasks to me. Once a week we also had a meeting about what could be improved.
